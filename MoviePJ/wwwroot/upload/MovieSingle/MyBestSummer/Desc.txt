Desc: the story of Canh Canh and Du Hoai, two high school students who reluctantly became friends because of their names, spending 3 years of high school together. In the movie Ha Lam Dau plays the female lead Canh Canh, a "study student", although her academic performance is not good but she always tries to strive. Ha Lam Dau with mushroom hair in a loose white and blue uniform and a lovely face, very suitable for the character's image. Makes viewers feel like they're being transported back to their own student days
